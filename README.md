# gsoLibs
Gamsteron's Laboratory

Installation: https://github.com/gamsteron/gsoLibs/releases/tag/Installer
You need wait for: "download complete ..." status.

.exe installer (you need run it only once - this is open source exe file - you can see code in any .net debugger)
This will create folders, add auto updater, download all files from https://github.com/gamsteron/gsoLibs  +  download testLoader.lua to Scripts folder
Select testLoader.lua in loader.exe and you can use my new orbwalker.
